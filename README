External Documentation

This program allows two users to play a game of chess
against each other. 

Go to en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_Chess for details on how 
to play chess.

By clicking on one of the pieces, the user can select the
piece they wish to move. By clicking the next position the 
user can select the place that they wish to move their piece.
If they choose place with the other team's piece placed on it,
they will capture the piece, and it will appear on the right
side of the board.If the user selects a position with one of
their own pieces on it, the new piece will be selected.

When the window is closed the game is saved, and when the 
program is opened again it will load the previously saved game.

If the user wishes to reset the game they may click the button
on the top left corner. If they want to change colours, there
is a drop down menu on the top menu bar.

TO RUN:
One should be able to run the program by simply clicking on
the .jar file in the main directory. If this does not work,
make sure you have the Java runtime environment 7 (JRE7). If
this does not work try installing the Java development kit 7
(jdk7). If this does not work, download and install the netbeans
IDE and copy this folder (Chess/) to NetBeansProjects/ (this 
should be automatically created by netbeans).
